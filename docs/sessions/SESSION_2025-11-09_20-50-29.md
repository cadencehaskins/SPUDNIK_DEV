---

## USER PROFILE

**Name:** Cadence Haskins
**Role:** Fluid Power Engineering at Spudnik
**Experience Level:** Complete beginner in coding (first project)
**Working With:** ChatGPT previously, now using Claude Code
**Communication Preference:** Bite-sized information, not walls of text, iterative questions

---

## DECISIONS MADE

### Technology Stack
- **Approach:** Start simple, beginner-friendly
- **Core:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla, no framework initially)
- **Flowchart Library:** Drawflow (to be installed)
- **Excel Export:** SheetJS (xlsx library)
- **UI Framework:** Bootstrap or Tailwind (TBD, likely Bootstrap for ease)
- **Development:** VS Code, Node.js + npm for packages only, no backend
- **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Phase 1: Local only (proof of concept)
  - Future: Internal network capable
  - Architecture: Flexible, no database dependencies

### Architectural Decisions
1. **Configuration-Driven:** Parts catalog and rules in JSON (easy modification)
2. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Loose coupling between components
3. **Simple State Management:** Centralized state object (can upgrade later)
4. **No Backend Initially:** Pure frontend, deployable anywhere
5. **Progressive Enhancement:** Start minimal, add features incrementally
6. **Modular Code Organization:** Clear separation of concerns

### Data Storage
- **Phase 1:** File-based (JSON export/import)
- **Future Option:** Database if project scales

---

## RESEARCH COMPLETED

### Spudnik Company Research
**Completed:** 2025-11-09 via web research subagent
**Source:** https://www.spudnik.com/
**Documents Created:**
- Company overview (history, mission, 500+ employees, Blackfoot ID)
- Product line research (focus on 990 Eliminator)
- Technical/hydraulic systems overview

### Key Technical Findings
- **Standard Pressure:** 2800 PSI across Spudnik equipment
- **Flow Range:** 40-80 GPM depending on equipment
- **Remote Valves:** 3-6 typical
- **990 Eliminator:** 5 widths (48", 60", 72", 84", 96"), chain or belt, optional features
- **Customization:** High - multiple configurations possible
- **Current Pain Point:** Manual schematic searching, time-consuming, error-prone

---

## SCOPE OF WORK (FROM USER'S DOCUMENT)

### Version 1 Deliverables
1. Standalone browser-based configurator (HTML/CSS/JS)
2. Visual flowchart builder:
   - Multiple power units and pumps
   - Each pump maintains independent buildable branch
   - Interactive node placement/deletion
3. Rule-based evaluation engine:
   - Determines recommended assemblies
   - Applies logic for flow dividers, PO checks, load holding, valves
   - "Reason for inclusion" text for auditability
4. Pump capacity validation:
   - Flags when branch demand exceeds pump flow/pressure
5. Output formats:
   - BOM Preview (in-browser)
   - Export to Excel and JSON

### Out of Scope (v1)
- Electrical or pneumatic systems
- Integration with Automation Studio, NX, Teamcenter (later)
- Commercial/quoting applications (later)

### Success Criteria
- Engineers can build standard 990 hydraulic config without paper schematics
- System consistently recommends accurate assemblies
- Exported Excel BOM provides reliable foundation for design review
