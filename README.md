# 990 Eliminator Engineering Preview Configurator (EPC)

A browser-based hydraulic system design tool for Spudnik's 990 Eliminator line.

## Project Status
🚧 **In Development** - Proof of Concept Phase

## Overview
The 990 EPC is an interactive tool that allows Fluid Power Engineers to:
- Visually build hydraulic system configurations using a flowchart interface
- Automatically receive assembly recommendations based on engineering rules
- Validate pump capacity and system requirements
- Generate Bills of Materials (BOM) for manufacturing
